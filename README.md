# Gobal Climate and Energy Analysis

A data-driven, visual analysis of global CO₂ emissions, energy use, and economic growth using Python. This little project explores emission and energy trends, CO₂–GDP relationships, time-series forecasting, and interactive visualizations designed for dashboards. The purpose of it was to hone my PowerBI/Python skills and to look at some data that I thought were interesting. 

## Data
The analysis is based on the OWID energy and CO2 data sets over the period 1990-2022. Check the codebook.csv for every variable used and their description.
